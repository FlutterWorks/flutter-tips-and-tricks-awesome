# Downloads Count by Version on Pub.dev

Did you know?

An improved weekly downloads chart was recently added on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/).

This lets you see package download counts by version (major, minor, patch).

To view it, click on the scores tab and scroll to the bottom (took me a while to find it ðŸ˜…).
