# Using Semantics Identifiers for UI Testing

Did you know?

UI testing frameworks like Maestro and Appium rely on Flutterâ€™s **semantics tree** to interact with your app UI.

If your app is localized, you can make your UI tests more robust by adding a **semantic identifier** to your widgets:

Here's how. ðŸ‘‡

UI testing frameworks like Maestro and Appium rely on Flutterâ€™s semantics tree to interact with your app UI.

If your app is localized, you can make your UI tests more robust by adding a semantic identifier to your widgets:

Semantics(
  identifier: 'save-button',
  child: ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: _submit,
    child: Text('Save'),
  ),
)

This way, you can reference your widget by ID (rather than text) in your UI tests

# Example Maestro test flow
appId: com.example.yourApp
name: "Test User Flows"
---
- launchApp

- tapOn:
    id: "save-button"
    label: "Tap on Save button"
