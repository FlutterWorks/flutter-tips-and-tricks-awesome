# Generate Screenshots with Maestro

Did you know?

Instead of taking screenshots manually for each device & language, you can automate it with Maestro!

Here's a video preview:

How to use this in practice?

Simply write a YAML file to define how Maestro should interact with your app UI and call `takeScreenshot` as needed.

Super easyâ€”no test harness required! ðŸš€

<!--
# A basic Maestro YAML flow
# Launch the app with the given appId
appId: com.codewithandrea.flutterShipApp
name: "Take screenshots"
---
- launchApp:
    # Clear local storage before startup (SharedPreferences, SQLite, etc.)
    clearState: true

- tapOn:
    # Semantic identifiers make the flows more robust
    id: "app-0"
    # Labels make the output log more readable
    label: "Select app #1"

- takeScreenshot:
    # Saved screenshots can then be edited in Figma and uploaded to the stores.
    path: screenshots/${LANG}/${DEVICE}/1_app

Once your flow is ready, run with:
maestro test flow.yaml

Tip: Use Maestro Studio toÂ generate test flows interactively instead of writing YAML manually:
maestro studio
```
