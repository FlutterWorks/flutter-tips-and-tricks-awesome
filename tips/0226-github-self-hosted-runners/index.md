# GitHub Self-Hosted Runners

Did you know?

If you're using GitHub Actions for your CI/CD needs, you can setup a self-hosted runner to cut your build times and save money. üéØ

This is very easy to setup, and if you have an organization account, you can share one or more runners across all your repos. üëç

GitHub Self-Hosted Runners

Advantages:

- Reduce build times
- Save money
- Easier debugging (can inspect local build files)

To setup:
1. Create a runner
2. Follow the instructions to install on your local machine or VPS
3. Update your workflow to run on "self-hosted"
4. Run your builds

Notes:
- If you have a personal account, you need to create a self-hosted runner for each repository
- If you have a GitHub organization, create a self-hosted runner at the organization level ‚úÖ
