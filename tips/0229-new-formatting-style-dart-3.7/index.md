# New Formatting Style in Dart 3.7

Did you know?

Dart 3.7 introduces a new formatter that **automatically** adds or removes trailing commas, based on the max line length.

This means you no longer decide how to format your code! The tool now does it for you.

How it works (automatic formatting)

- Code fits on one line?
  - Remove trailing comma and inline code
- Code exceeds max line length?
  - Add trailing comma and split into multiple lines

How to use it (without going crazy)

# Set Dart SDK >= 3.7.0 in pubspec.yaml
environment:
  sdk: ^3.7.0

# SetÂ page_widthÂ inÂ analysis_options.yaml
formatter:
  page_width: 120

# Run from the root of your project
dart format . # This will make a ton of changes in your entire codebase

# Push all changes at once
git add .
git commit -m "Apply the new formatter"
git push
