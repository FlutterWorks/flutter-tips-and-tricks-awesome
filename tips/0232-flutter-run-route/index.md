# The flutter run --route argument

Did you know?

You can run `flutter run --route /path/to/route` to start your Flutter app from a specific route.

This works with named routes (nav 1.0) and the router APIs (nav 2.0).

Super useful for debugging nested routes when you need to hot-restart.

To start your app from a specific route, run:

flutter run --route /path/to/route

This is super useful youâ€™re debugging nested routes and you need to hot-restart the app. ðŸ’¯

This will work as long as the route exists and there are no redirects preventing from opening it.

If desired, you can also set it in your VSCode launch configuration:

{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Run",
      "request": "launch",
      "type": "dart",
      "args": [ "--route", "/jobs/add" ],
    }
  ]
}
