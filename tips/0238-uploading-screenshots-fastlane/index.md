# Uploading Screenshots with Fastlane

Did you know?

Rather than uploading your app store screenshots manually, you can automate the process with Fastlane!

Here's how ðŸ‘‡

<!--
Initial Setup:

1. Run `brew install fastlane` (on macOS)
2. Run `fastlane init` from the ios folder
3. Configure `Appfile` with your Apple credentials
4. Add a lane to the `Fastfile`

default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do
  desc "Upload screenshots to App Store Connect"
  lane :upload_screenshots_and_metadata do
    upload_to_app_store(
      skip_screenshots: false,
      skip_metadata: false,
      skip_binary_upload: true,
    )
  end
end

How to Upload:

1. Update the screenshots
2. Save the changes to git
3. Run the lane

fastlane upload_screenshots_and_metadata

Once done, all the screenshots will be uploaded to App Store Connect! ðŸš€

Android setup is very similar:

- Run fastlane init inside the android folder
- Use the upload_to_play_store action in the Fastfile
-->

Before uploading to the App Store, fastlane will show a preview so you can check if everything looks good.

You can skip this by passing `force: true` to the upload_to_app_store lane (useful for non-interactive CI workflows).
