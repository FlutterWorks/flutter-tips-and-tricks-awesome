# A/B Testing in Flutter

Did you know?

A/B tests help you make data-driven decisions and increase conversions in your app.

To run an A/B test:
1. Choose a metric to improve
2. Formulate a hypothesis
3. Split the audience into cohorts
4. Run an experiment, analyze the results, and roll out the winner ðŸ¥‡

If youâ€™re unsure between two UI/UX variants, how do you decide?

Solution: run an A/B test ðŸ§ª

1. Choose a metric to improve (e.g. how many times an icon is tapped)
2. Formulate a hypothesis (changing the icon will improve conversion)
3. Create variants and split the audience into cohorts
4. Run an experiment to collect a statistically significant sample size, analyze the results, and roll out the winner

Tools like Firebase Remote Config and PostHog make it easy to run A/B tests in your apps.

For example, here's a report from an A/B test I ran on my Flutter Tips app:

But how do you implement this in practice?

My latest course includes an entire module about Feature Toggles and A/B tests.
