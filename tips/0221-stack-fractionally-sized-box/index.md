# Using Stack and FractionallySizedBox

Did you know?

Flutter offers many ways to create custom layouts that can‚Äôt be expressed with `Row` and `Column`. üëç

For example, here's how to overlay multiple widgets inside a [Stack](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html) and constrain their size and position with [Positioned](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Positioned-class.html) and [FractionallySizedBox](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FractionallySizedBox-class.html). üëá

<!--

const n = 4;
// * Aspect ratio = 1 yields a square
return AspectRatio(
  aspectRatio: 1,
  // * Stack the squares on top of each other
  child: Stack(
    // * Generate n squares
    children: List.generate(n, (index) {
      // * Material colors have shades from 100 to 900
      final color = Colors.indigo[(index + 2) * 100]!;
      // * Fill the entire surface
      return Positioned.fill(
        // * Size child to a fraction of the available space
        child: FractionallySizedBox(
          // * Pick width and height between 0 and 1
          widthFactor: 1 - index / n,
          heightFactor: 1 - index / n,
          // * Choose the alignment of the child
          alignment: Alignment.topRight,
          // * Just a colored box
          child: ColoredBox(color: color),
        ),
      );
    }),
  ),
);
