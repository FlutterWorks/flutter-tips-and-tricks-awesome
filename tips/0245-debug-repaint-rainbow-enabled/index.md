# How to use debugRepaintRainbowEnabled

Did you know?

`debugRepaintRainbowEnabled` helps you discover widgets/areas that unexpectedly repaint in your app.

Here's how to set it ðŸ‘‡

![](245.gif)

<!--
import 'package:flutter/rendering.dart';

void main() {
  // Overlay a rotating set of colors when repainting layers in debug mode
  debugRepaintRainbowEnabled = true;
  runApp(const CarouselExampleApp());
}

Helps you find widgets that unexpectedly repaint in your app, so you can wrap them with RepaintBoundary.

If you discover widgets that repaint when they shouldn't, wrap them with `RepaintBoundary`.

This can improve rendering performance, but only use it when necessary (`RepaintBoundary` has some extra CPU/memory cost).
