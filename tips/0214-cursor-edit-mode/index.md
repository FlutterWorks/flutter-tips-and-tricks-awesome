# Improve your code with Cursor Edit Mode

Did you know?

The Cursor IDE has a powerful edit mode (hit `CMD+K` to enable it).

I find it quite useful for finding edge cases in my imperative code.

It doesn't always get it right, though! So make sure you tweak the output as needed and discard any unwanted changes. 🙇‍♂️
