# Release Toggles with Dart Defines

Did you know?

Static release toggles let you release unfinished code without activating it in production.

This is common with large projects that practice trunk-based deployment and continuous delivery.

For more flexibility, you can implement this with --dart-defines. ðŸ‘‡

Goal: Deploy unfinished code without activating it in production
(useful for trunk-based deployment)

How to Use

1. Define the toggles

class Toggles {
  static bool get showProductsAsGrid => const bool.fromEnvironment(
        'TOGGLE_PRODUCTS_AS_GRID',
        defaultValue: false,
      );

  // TODO: Add more toggles here
}

2. Use them as needed

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  if (Toggles.showProductsAsGrid) {
    return GridView.builder(...);
  } else {
    return ListView.builder(...);
  }
}

Benefits

- âœ… Centralize all toggles in a single file for easier maintenance
- âœ… Provide default values, easily override them with --dart-define
- âœ… Tree-shaking of unused code (toggles are const values)
- âœ… Flavor-friendly: can enable the toggle for dev & staging builds, and disable it for production

Static release toggles are easy to use, but some use cases require more flexibility:

- Experiment by showing different variants to separate user cohorts (A/B and multivariate testing)
- Gradually roll out a feature to users, rather than releasing it to everyone at once

---

Complex use cases require dynamic toggles and some dedicated infrastructure to manage them, and my latest course covers this topic in much more detail.
